	This book is written for people who are ready to change quadrants, 
especially for individuals who are currently in the E and S categories and 
are contemplating moving to the B or I category. This book is for people 
who are ready to move beyond job security and begin to achieve financial 
security. It’s not an easy life path, but the prize at the end of the road, 
financial freedom, is worth the journey. 
When I was 12 years old, rich dad told me a simple story that guided 
me to great wealth and financial freedom. It was his way of explaining the 
difference between the left side of the CASHFLOW Quadrant, the E and 
S quadrants, and the right side, or the B and I quadrants. The story goes 
like this:

<h4><b>SCHOOL</b></h4><br>
<h3>Introduction</h3><br>
“Once upon a time there was this quaint little village. It was a great 
place to live except for one problem. The village had no water unless it 
rained. To solve this problem once and for all, the village elders asked 
contractors to submit bids to deliver water to the village on a daily basis. 
Two people volunteered to take on the task, and the elders awarded the 
contract to both of them. They felt that a little competition would keep 
prices low and ensure a backup supply of water.
<br>
“The first person who won the contract, Ed, immediately ran out, 
bought two galvanized steel buckets and began running back and forth 
to the lake which was a mile away. He immediately began making 
money as he labored morning to dusk, hauling water from the lake with 
his two buckets. He would empty them into the large concrete holding 
tank the village had built. Each morning he had to get up before the rest 
of the village awoke to make sure there was enough water for the people. 
It was hard work, but he was very happy to be making money and for 
having one of the two exclusive contracts for this business.
“The second winning contractor, Bill, disappeared for a while. 
He wasn’t seen for months, which made Ed very happy, since he had 
no competition.
<br> 
“Instead of buying two buckets to compete with Ed, Bill wrote a 
business plan, created a corporation, found four investors, employed 
a president to do the work, and returned six months later with a 
construction crew. Within a year, his team had built a large-volume 
stainless-steel pipeline which connected the village to the lake.
“At the grand-opening celebration, Bill announced that his 
water was cleaner than Ed’s water. Bill knew that the villagers had 
complained about the water’s lack of cleanliness. Bill also announced 
that he could supply the village with water 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week. Ed could only deliver water on weekdays because he didn’t want 
to work on weekends. Then Bill announced that he would charge 
75 percent less than Ed did for this higher-quality, more-reliable water. 
The villagers cheered and immediately ran for the faucet at the end 
of Bill’s pipeline.
