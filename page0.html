			<p style="font-size: 19px">Atouching tale of battling cancer set against the backdrop of the prosperity gospel.Bowler (Duke Divinity School; Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel, 2013), a specialist in the study of the prosperity gospel, found her life turned upside down in her mid-30s with a diagnosis of stage 4 colon cancer. Here, she chronicles her journey from what seemed a death sentence to a lifestyle of living from one medical test to another, surviving as a result of the effects of a clinical trial and a stalwart community of friends and family. Throughout, the author delivers raw emotion, realistic description, and candid assessments, and she weaves in references to the faith system she has studied and, indeed, of which she has become a community member.An inspiring story of finding faith—in God, in family, and in oneself—while walking close to the valley of the shadow of death.

	<p style="font-size: 19px">Strength and fearlessness are the two prime virtues which are the markers of  the health of a human being and society. Every crime and  and antisocial and inhuman act is the outcome of lack of true strength and fearlessness. But what do we mean by strength, and what does fearlessness connote? In this booklet published by Advaita Ashrama, a publication branch of Ramakrishna Math, Belur Math, Swami Tathagatananda has presented Vivekananda’s views on this subject. We are sure the author's presentation will shed new light on our understanding of these eternal virtues and will urge our younger generation to imbibe and practice them.
